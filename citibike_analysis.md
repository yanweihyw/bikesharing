# NYC Citi Bike Analysis
Dear investor,
Thank you for coming to see my presentation for NYC Citi Bike Analysis. In this analysis, we have analyzed New York Aug, 2019’s bike data. The purpose of the report is to show New York’s bike situation and want to find out if it is a good choice to start the bike-sharing program in Des Moines.

## Answers to question of gender's affect on ride records: 
First, I want to answer the question:
What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?
Based on city census data, Des Moines has 50.8% female and New York has 51.4% female. Based on bike riding data in New York, male would prefer to ride bike. From bike riding data, 1.53 million records of bike riding is from male and 0.589 million records of bike riding is from female. It means male’s rides are 2.6 times of female’s rides. In the situation that female population is 51.4% in New York. It indicates male would prefer to ride bikes. As Des Moines has a lower female ratio, Des Moines should be beneficial for bike program.
##Other findings for NYC biking program
## New York’s bike riding data also shows several other points:
### Riding potentials:
New York City has an estimate population of 19.5 million for 2019. With that population, the August ride record is 2.3million. This is about 12%. Des Moines city has a population about 214 thousand for 2019. If the ride ratio is the same, the monthly ride for Des Moines city is about 26 thousand. Which would also be good enough to start the program.
New York City’s subscriber customers have rides bike more frequently. Subscribe ridings are 4.28 times of customer riders. Similar to New York, Des Moines is also a tourist city. But as subscriber would prefer to use bike rides more frequently. We should put our focus on subscriber-local residents.
### Riders' age:
New York City’s people who ride bikes more frequently are born around 1970 and 1990. That means age of 49 and age of 29. For New York, the people between 18 and 65 is about 62.4%. For Des Moines, people between 18 and 65 is about 63.8%. Des Moines has a good ratio for people who likes to ride bikes.
### Riding peak time:
New York City’s Aug peak time is in the afternoon 5pm to 7pm. It is reasonable as these hours are time when the weather is not hot but the daylight is still good. Des Moines has similar latitude to New York City. The climates of both cities are similar and suitable for bike riding.
### Preferred riding place:
New York City’s people likes to ride bikes near rivers. Des Moines has Gray’s Lake and several rivers. It has suitable environment for people to ride bikes.

In conclusion. It should be suitable for Des Moines to develop bike sharing program.
